Changes in 0.5:
  o API Changes:
    * searchPath elements now have additional attributes exposed
      which denote contexts to which they apply.  Right now, the
      two attributes exposed are isResolveTrove and isGroupSearchPathTrove
      which default to True (no change in behavior) but can be
      set to limit the applicability of an element.  In addition,
      product definition objects have additional getResolveTroves
      and getGroupSearchPaths methods which filter the searchPaths
      by the attributes exposed. (RPCL-53)

  o Bug Fixes:
    * 2.0: Don't add platform defaults if proddef defines any of
      containerTemplates, architectures, buildTemplates, flavorSets (RPCL-54).

  o Schema Versions:
    * 2.0: Backward-compatible extension to support RPCL-53.

Changes in 0.4:
  o API Changes:
    * Images are now defined differently.  Platforms provide
      generic information about image types, architectures, and sets
      of flavors, which are then referenced from build definitions
      in individual product-definition.xml files.  As part of this
      work, the UnsupportedImageType and ImageTemplateNotFoundError
      exceptions have been removed, and the FlavorSetNotFoundError,
      ContainerTemplateNotFoundError, and BuildTemplateNotFoundError
      exceptions have been added.  Incompatible XML schema changes
      were required, introducing schema version 2.0.  These changes
      are reflected in extensive API changes that are not
      backwards-compatible. (RPCL-21, RPCL-25, RPCL-46)
    * Exception classes have been changed to have names that consistently
      end in "Error": ProductDefinitionTroveNotFound is now
      ProductDefinitionTroveNotFoundError, ProductDefinitionFileNotFound
      is now ProductDefinitionFileNotFoundError, and 
      InvalidSchemaVersionError has been added.
    * The sourceGroup element specifies the source from which a group
      is built.  New APIs have been added to produce and consume the
      sourceGroup element:
        ProductDefinition.getSourceGroup()
        ProductDefinition.setSourceGroup(sourceGroup)
        Build.getBuildSourceGroup()
      (RPCL-44)
    * Search path entries now have a getTroveTup() method to
      produce a consistent trovespec tuple for both the search path item
      and the label from which it was selected. (RPCL-51)

  Bug Fixes:
    * Several platform attributes previously were not copied into a
      product definition during a rebase operation.  This has been
      fixed. (RPCL-48)

  o Schema Versions:
    * 2.0: Modifications required for RPCL-21, RPCL-44, sourceGroup

Changes in 0.3:
  Bug Fixes:
    * The rebase operation now succeeds when an explicit baseLabel
      is provided in the product definition. (RPCL-36)

Changes in 0.2:
  o API Changes:
    * Richer flavor support: for both platform and product, there are
      base flavor, image flavors, and architecture flavors that are
      mixed together to discover flavors of groups to cook and images
      to build. (RPCL-13)
    * When the default label prefix is not the label for a product,
      a different label prefix ("baseLabel") can be provided.  Stage
      suffixes will still be appended to this label. (RPCL-18)
    * Arbitrary label mappings can be provided for promote
      operations with "promoteMap" elements. (RPCL-17)

  o Schema Versions:
    * 1.2: Initial support for richer flavors (RPCL-13)
    * 1.3: Added baseLabel

Changes in 0.1:
  o API Changes:
    * proddef.py moved into rpath_common module.
    * More consistent API function and method naming: elem_dict
      changed to elementDict, elem_obj changed to elementObject,
      elem_list change to elementList.
    * API versioning added via explicit imports
    * Use rpath_common.xmllib instead of conary.lib.xmldata
