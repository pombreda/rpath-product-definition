Changes in 0.4:
  o API Changes:
    * Richer flavor support: for both platform and product, there are
      base flavor, image flavors, and architecture flavors that are
      mixed together to discover flavors of groups to cook and images
      to build.  As part of this work, the UnsupportedImageType and
      ImageTemplateNotFoundError exceptions have been removed, and
      the FlavorSetNotFoundError, ContainerTemplateNotFoundError,
      and BuildTemplateNotFoundError exceptions have been added.
      Incompatible schema changes were required, introducing schema
      version 2.0.  These changes are reflected in API changes that
      are not backwards-compatible. (RPCL-13)
    * Exception classes have been changed to have names that consistently
      end in "Error": ProductDefinitionTroveNotFound is now
      ProductDefinitionTroveNotFoundError, ProductDefinitionFileNotFound
      is now ProductDefinitionFileNotFoundError, and the

  Bug Fixes:
    * Several platform attributes previously were not copied into a
      product definition during a rebase operation.  This has been
      fixed. (RPCL-48)

  o Schema Versions:
    * 2.0: Modifications required for RPCL-13

Changes in 0.3:
  Bug Fixes:
    * The rebase operation now succeeds when an explicit baseLabel
      is provided in the product definition. (RPCL-36)

Changes in 0.2:
  o API Changes:
    * When the default label prefix is not the label for a product,
      a different label prefix ("baseLabel") can be provided.  Stage
      suffixes will still be appended to this label. (RPCL-18)
    * Arbitrary label mappings can be provided for promote
      operations with "promoteMap" elements. (RPCL-17)

  o Schema Versions:
    * 1.2: Initial support for richer flavors (RPCL-13)
    * 1.3: Added baseLabel

Changes in 0.1:
  o API Changes:
    * proddef.py moved into rpath_common module.
    * More consistent API function and method naming: elem_dict
      changed to elementDict, elem_obj changed to elementObject,
      elem_list change to elementList.
    * API versioning added via explicit imports
    * Use rpath_common.xmllib instead of conary.lib.xmldata
