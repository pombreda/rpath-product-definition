Changes in 0.2:
  o API Changes:
    * Richer flavor support: for both platform and product, there are
      base flavor, image flavors, and architecture flavors that are
      mixed together to discover flavors of groups to cook and images
      to build. (RPCL-13)
    * When the default label prefix is not the label for a product,
      a different label prefix ("baseLabel") can be provided.  Stage
      suffixes will still be appended to this label. (RPCL-18)

  o Schema Versions:
    * 1.2: Initial support for richer flavors (RPCL-13)
    * 1.3: Added baseLabel

Changes in 0.1:
  o API Changes:
    * proddef.py moved into rpath_common module.

      changed to elementDict, elem_obj changed to elementObject,
      elem_list change to elementList.
    * API versioning added via explicit imports
    * Use rpath_common.xmllib instead of conary.lib.xmldata
